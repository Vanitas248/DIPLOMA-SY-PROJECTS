# DIPLOMA-SY-PROJECTS
Starting my journey into coding as a direct second-year diploma student feels both exciting and challenging. While many of my peers may have had some exposure to programming in their first year, I am stepping into this world with fresh eyes and a lot of enthusiasm. Coding is a skill that shapes the future, and as I take my first steps, I am eager to learn, explore, and grow. I look forward to building a strong foundation and tackling each concept as it comes, knowing that each line of code brings me closer to a world of endless possibilities.

#TIC TAC TOE(USING TURBO C):
This C++ program brings Tic Tac Toe to your screen, letting you and a friend play the classic game in a simple, visual format. The game is straightforward: two players take turns placing either an "X" or an "O" on a 3x3 grid, aiming to align three of their symbols in a row, column, or diagonal.

How It Works:
Drawing the Game Board: The drawBoard function sets up the Tic Tac Toe grid on the right side of the screen, dividing it into nine squares where you can place your moves.

Marking Moves: When it’s your turn, the drawMove function draws your chosen symbol in the spot you pick. Player 1 uses "X" and Player 2 uses "O," with each symbol in a different color for easy recognition.

Checking for a Winner: The checkWin function watches each move, checking rows, columns, and diagonals to see if someone has won. If all spots fill up without a winner, it declares a draw.

Taking Turns: When it’s your turn, the program asks for your move: you just enter the row and column numbers for your chosen spot. If the spot is empty, it places your symbol there; if not, it’ll prompt you to pick a different spot.

Playing the Game: In the main game loop, you and your friend take turns until there’s a winner or the game board is full. At the end, a message appears to announce the winner or say it’s a draw if no one won.

This program keeps everything simple and visual. It focuses on delivering a smooth, fun experience of Tic Tac Toe on your screen, making it easy to enjoy this classic game with a friend.
